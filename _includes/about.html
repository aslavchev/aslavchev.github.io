        <p>Throughout my career at companies like VMware and Tumba Solutions, I’ve led QA initiatives, mentored new
          engineers, and collaborated across international teams to deliver high-quality digital products.</p>
        <p>I bring deep expertise in test design, automation (Selenium + Java), and mobile/web QA — all driven by a
          strong commitment to precision and customer satisfaction.</p>
